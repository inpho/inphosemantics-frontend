Indiana Philosophy Ontology Project
Semantics Frontend

The frontend is a web-interface mean to remotely access term relatedness data over varying corpora and models. The data is retrieved from a JSON object of the generic form below:

[{related-term_1:similarity_1},
 {related-term_2:similarity_2},
 ...,
 {related-term_n-1:similarity_n-1},
 {related-term_n:similarity_n}
]

Currently, this interface is implemented to run solely on the SEP-BEAGLE lexicon/model; however, the ultimate goal is to generalize this interface to run on any lexicon/model combination.


To view example data, simply initiate a simple server and browse to http://localhost:8080 in your preferred web-browser.
e.g.:
$> cd inphosemantics-frontend/
$> ./tinyserver.py
